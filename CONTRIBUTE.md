# Contributing? 

This repo is a consilidation of scripts that I have posted on my blog, and on various forums over the last decade. I'm happy to share the code and let others copy it without limitaion (The Unlicense License), but it doesn't really make sense to have others contribute completely new scripts, given the purpose of the repo. I just want to share my work and consolidate it. 

However! I'm totally open to community-submitted issues or PRs that improve my existing scripts, or requests for new scripts! Feel free to create an issue for a new script idea, and if your use case seems like it will be helpful for the wider Apps Script community, I'll be glad to give it a shot.
