Collection of Google Apps Script Utility Functions

*Author: Joseph Petty, Founder @ GreenFlux, LLC*

## Description
This repo is a collection of Google Apps Scripts that I had originally posted on my blog and several other forums. For the repo version, I'm updating all the scripts to use the same sample dataset, which can be copied here [sample-data](https://www.google.com). 

### Work In Progress
Working on backlog of scripts from my old blog posts. Check back for updates! 

## Scripts
|name|description|
|----|-----------|
|[docImgToFolder]([scripts/Doc Images to Folder](https://github.com/GreenFluxLLC/google-apps-script-utils/tree/main/scripts/Doc%20Images%20to%20Folder)) | Extracts all image from Doc with sourceId and saves them to folderId (or new folder if not specified)|
|[postImgToFolder](scripts/Doc Images to Folder) | Saves an image to folderId (or new folder) when the URL is sent as a POST request to a webapp.|
